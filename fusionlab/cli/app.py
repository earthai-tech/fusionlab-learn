Defines the command-line interface (CLI) for launching GUI applications.

This module uses the `click` library to create a dedicated command
group, `app`, which serves as the entry point for starting the various
graphical user interfaces provided by the `fusionlab-learn` library,
such as the "Subsidence PINN Mini GUI".
