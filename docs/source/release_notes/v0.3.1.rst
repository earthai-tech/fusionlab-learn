**Focus: Backend Dependency Management**

This is a maintenance release that completely
overhauls how the library handles its optional heavy dependencies,
particularly `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, and `KerasTuner`. The primary goal
of this refactor is to eliminate a class of circular import errors that
were causing build failures in clean environments like Read the Docs,
and to make the entire codebase more maintainable and scalable.

Enhancements & Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* |Enhancement| **Centralized Configuration:** Introduced a new internal
  module, **fusionlab/_configs.py**, which now serves as the single
  source of truth for all backend dependency mappings. Hardcoded
  dictionaries have been removed from individual modules.

* |Enhancement| **Config-Driven Dependency Loaders:** The dependency
  loaders in ``fusionlab/compat/``, such as `KerasDependencies`, now
  read directly from the central configuration. This makes them more
  robust and easier to maintain.

* |Enhancement| **Smart Dummy Objects:** Introduced a new internal
  module, **fusionlab/_dummies.py**, which dynamically generates
  placeholder objects for uninstalled dependencies. This dummy system
  is also driven by the central configuration, ensuring it is always
  perfectly in sync with the real dependency loader.

* |Enhancement| **Simplified Module Imports:** The `__init__.py` files for
  the `nn` and `forecast_tuner` subpackages now perform a single check for
  dependencies and create a single, authoritative `KERAS_DEPS` or `KT_DEPS`
  object. This eliminates the need for redundant `if/else` blocks and
  local dummy class definitions in individual model and utility files,
  making the codebase significantly cleaner.

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* |API Change| The internal logic for handling optional dependencies has
  been completely refactored. While the public-facing API for models
  and functions remains the same, the mechanism for importing them
  is now centralized. This change is internal but represents a major
  architectural shift towards a more robust and scalable design.

Fixes
~~~~~
* |Fix| **Resolved Circular Import Errors:** The primary motivation for
  this release. The new centralized dependency system, combined with
  the standard practice of using local imports for internal modules,
  definitively resolves the `ImportExceptionGroup` and `ExtensionError`
  failures that were occurring during documentation builds on Read the
  Docs.

Tests
~~~~~
* |Tests| The internal test suite has been updated to validate the
  new dependency loading mechanism, ensuring that both the real and
  dummy objects are created and accessed correctly.
