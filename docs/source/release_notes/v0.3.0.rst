**Focus: Advanced PINNs and Flexible Attentive Architectures**

This is a milestone release that significantly refactors the core
attentive model architecture and introduces a powerful, flexible new
generation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The focus has
been on modularity, robustness, and providing users with greater
control over the model architecture to tackle a wider range of
complex forecasting problems. This new foundation enables 
a state-of-the-art generation of PINNs and is complemented by a 
unified hyperparameter tuner, ``HydroTuner``, designed for all 
hydrogeological models.

Enhancements & Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* |New| Introduced :class:`~fusionlab.nn.models.BaseAttentive`,
  a powerful and flexible base class that encapsulates the
  entire encoder-decoder and attention logic. This provides a
  consistent, modular foundation for all advanced forecasting
  models in the library.
* |New| The base architecture includes a ``mode`` parameter
  (``'tft_like'`` or ``'pihal_like'``) to control how known
  future features are handled, allowing for both TFT-style input
  enrichment and standard encoder-decoder data flows.
* |New| :class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.models.TransFlowSubsNet`:
  A state-of-the-art, fully-coupled PINN that simultaneously
  models both **transient groundwater flow** and **aquifer-system
  consolidation**. This is the new flagship model for complex
  hydrogeological forecasting.
* |New| :class:`~fusionlab.nn.models.HALNet`: The powerful,
  data-driven Hybrid Attentive LSTM Network is now available as
  a standalone model, serving as a robust, general-purpose
  forecasting tool without physics components.
* |New| :class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.PiTGWFlow`: A self-contained,
  pure-physics PINN for solving the 2D transient groundwater
  flow equation, ideal for forward and inverse problems.
* |Enhancement| The legacy **:class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.models.PIHALNet`**
  has also been re-architected to inherit from `BaseAttentive`,
  benefiting from the new configuration system and modularity.
* |New| Introduced :class:`~fusionlab.nn.forecast_tuner.HydroTuner`:
  A flexible, model-agnostic tuner for all hydrogeological PINNs.
  By simply passing the model class (`PIHALNet` or
  `TransFlowSubsNet`), it dynamically adapts its search space.
* |New| Added :class:`~fusionlab.nn.forecast_tuner.HALTuner`, a
  dedicated tuner for the new standalone ``HALNet`` model.
  
* **Code Example (New Flexible** ``HALNet``):

  .. code-block:: python
     :linenos:

     import numpy as np
     import tensorflow as tf
     from fusionlab.nn.models import HALNet

     # 1. Define model config for "tft_like" mode
     TIME_STEPS, HORIZON = 8, 4
     halnet_tft = HALNet(
         mode='tft_like',
         static_input_dim=3, dynamic_input_dim=5, future_input_dim=2,
         output_dim=1, forecast_horizon=HORIZON, max_window_size=TIME_STEPS
     )

     # Data must span both lookback and forecast periods
     future_span_tft = TIME_STEPS + HORIZON
     inputs_tft = [
         tf.random.normal((2, 3)), # Static
         tf.random.normal((2, TIME_STEPS, 5)), # Dynamic
         tf.random.normal((2, future_span_tft, 2)) # Future
     ]
     output_tft = halnet_tft(inputs_tft)
     print(f"TFT-like mode output shape: {output_tft.shape}")

     # 2. Define model config for "pihal_like" mode
     halnet_pihal = HALNet(
         mode='pihal_like',
         static_input_dim=3, dynamic_input_dim=5, future_input_dim=2,
         output_dim=1, forecast_horizon=HORIZON, max_window_size=TIME_STEPS
     )
     # Data only needs to cover the forecast horizon for future features
     future_span_pihal = HORIZON
     inputs_pihal = [
         tf.random.normal((2, 3)), # Static
         tf.random.normal((2, TIME_STEPS, 5)), # Dynamic
         tf.random.normal((2, future_span_pihal, 2)) # Future
     ]
     output_pihal = halnet_pihal(inputs_pihal)
     print(f"PIHAL-like mode output shape: {output_pihal.shape}")

* |New| A suite of PINN-specific utilities have been added,
  including the critical
  :func:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.utils.prepare_pinn_data_sequences`
  function for handling complex input requirements.
* |New| New spatial utilities in :mod:`~fusionlab.utils.spatial_utils`,
  including `create_spatial_clusters` and `batch_spatial_sampling`,
  have been introduced to aid in geospatial feature engineering.
  
* |Enhancement| Visualization functions like
  :func:`~fusionlab.plot.forecast.plot_forecast_by_step` and
  :func:`~fusionlab.plot.forecast.forecast_view` have been added
  and improved for more insightful analysis of forecast results.
* |Enhancement| This new base class is highly configurable via an
  **architecture_config** dictionary, supporting:
  
  * Two distinct encoder architectures: ``'hybrid'`` (default),
    which uses :class:`~fusionlab.nn.components.MultiScaleLSTM`,
    and ``'transformer'``, which uses a pure self-attention stack.
  * A fully modular ``decoder_attention_stack``, giving users
    fine-grained control over the attention mechanisms.
* |Enhancement| The new tuners' ``.create()`` factory method can
  **automatically infer** data-dependent parameters (like
  input/output dimensions) directly from NumPy arrays,
  significantly simplifying the setup process.
  
* **Code Example (New** ``HydroTuner`` **Workflow):**

  .. code-block:: python
     :linenos:

     from fusionlab.nn.forecast_tuner import HydroTuner
     from fusionlab.nn.pinn.models import TransFlowSubsNet
     # Assume 'inputs' and 'targets' are pre-prepared NumPy dicts

     # 1. Define a search space for the model
     search_space = {
         "embed_dim": [32, 64],
         "dropout_rate": {"type": "float", "min_value": 0.1, "max_value": 0.3},
         "K": ["learnable", 1e-4],  # Physics HP for TransFlowSubsNet
         "learning_rate": [1e-3, 5e-4]
     }

     # 2. Instantiate the Tuner using the .create() factory method
     tuner = HydroTuner.create(
         model_name_or_cls=TransFlowSubsNet, # Specify the model to tune
         inputs_data=inputs,
         targets_data=targets,
         search_space=search_space,
         max_trials=10,
         project_name="New_TransFlow_Tuning"
     )

     # 3. Run the search
     print("Starting tuning with the new HydroTuner...")
     best_model, best_hps, _ = tuner.run(
         inputs=inputs,
         y=targets,
         epochs=20,
         callbacks=[tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping('val_loss', patience=5)]
     )


Fixes
~~~~~
* |Fix| **Architectural Overhaul**: Completely refactored the internal
  logic of :class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.models.PIHALNet` 
  (now :class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.BaseAttentive`) to use a robust
  encoder-decoder architecture. This permanently fixes a series of
  `ValueError` and `InvalidArgumentError` exceptions related to
  shape mismatches that occurred when `time_steps` and
  `forecast_horizon` were different.
* |Fix| **Residual Connections**: Corrected the logic for residual
  connections (`Add` + `LayerNormalization`) to handle the
  ``use_residuals=False`` case correctly, preventing `TypeError`
  exceptions. All feature dimensions within the attention blocks are
  now consistent, resolving shape mismatches.
* |Fix| **Positional Encoding**: Replaced the naive linear positional
  encoding with the standard, robust sinusoidal implementation from
  `"Attention Is All You Need"`. Fixed an issue where a single
  instance was incorrectly used on tensors with different feature
  dimensions.
* |Fix| **PINN Gradient Calculation**: Refactored :class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.models.PiTGWFlow` to
  decouple prediction from residual calculation. The `train_step` now
  manages a single ``GradientTape`` context, fixing a `ValueError` where
  gradients could not be computed due to a broken computational path.

* |Fix| Corrected the gradient flow in PINN models to improve
  stability, especially when training with very low physics-loss
  weights.
* |Fix| Enhanced the :func:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.utils.prepare_pinn_data_sequences` 
  utility to better handle edge cases with single-group time series.
* |Fix| The `search` method in ``PINNTunerBase`` now correctly handles
  TensorFlow Datasets where the target `y` is already a tensor,
  improving compatibility with non-PINN models.


Tests
~~~~~
* |Tests| Added a comprehensive Pytest suite for the new :class:`~fusionlab.nn.mdoels.HALNet`
  and :class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.TransFlowSubsNet` models, validating both ``'tft_like'`` and
  ``'pihal_like'`` modes.
* |Tests| Created a robust test suite for :class:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.PiTGWFlow`, covering
  instantiation, learnable parameter tracking, forward pass with
  multiple input formats, and the custom `train_step`.
* |Tests| Added a Pytest suite for the :class:`~fusionlab.nn.components.PositionalEncoding` layer
  to ensure numerical stability, shape consistency, and serialization.

* |Tests| Added a comprehensive test suite for the new :class:`~fusionlab.nn.forecast_tuner.HydroTuner`,
  covering instantiation, the `.create()` factory method, and
  end-to-end runs for both `PIHALNet` and `TransFlowSubsNet`.
* |Tests| Implemented unit tests for all new data utilities,
  including :func:`~fusionlab.nn.pinn.utils.prepare_pinn_data_sequences`,
  :func:`~fusionlab.utils.data_utils.widen_temporal_columns`,
  and the spatial utilities.
* |Tests| Expanded model tests to validate the new
  ``architecture_config`` functionality in ``BaseAttentive``.
